# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

Follow these steps to push this project to a new GitHub repository:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter "nice-systems-junie" as the Repository name
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**:
   - After creating the repository, GitHub will show setup instructions
   - Copy the HTTPS URL of your repository (it will look like: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nice-systems-junie.git)
   - Run this command in your terminal, replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username:
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nice-systems-junie.git
     ```

3. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   - Run this command to push your code:
     ```
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:
     ```
     git push -u origin master
     ```

4. **Verify the push**:
   - Visit your repository on GitHub to confirm that all files have been pushed successfully

Note: If you're prompted for GitHub credentials, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.
